It increases the propensity of STING to dimerize and associate with the kinase TBK1, enhancing the ability of STING to activate IRF3 and NF-κB and induce a type I IFN response. However, the R284M mutation occurs outside of the dimerization region between positions 153-177, so rather than a direct effect on dimerization, it is predicted to promote or inhibit binding of a cellular factor that stabilizes or impairs STING dimerization.",,STING M284 variant (human recombinant),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/23594

The S162A point mutation is located in the cyclic dinucleotide binding site of the human STING variants R232 and H232 and allows human STING to bind to DMXAA, a compound previously known to bind mouse, but not human, STING. When STING S162A is bound to DMXAA, it adopts the closed conformation, similar to the conformation it has when bound to the second messenger 2’3’-cGAMP (Item No. ), and activates the IFN pathway similarly to mouse STING.",,STING A162 variant (human recombinant),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/25306
,,23592,"STING AQ variant (human recombinant) contains amino acids 138-379 of the wild-type STING variant (R232) with an alanine substituted for glycine at position 230 and a glutamine substituted for arginine at position 293. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a component of the innate immune response that binds to cyclic dinucleotides, which are bacterial second messengers. Recognition of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), c-di-AMP, or c-GMP-AMP leads to activation of NF-κB and transcription of immunomodulatory genes, including type I interferons (IFN). The R232 variant of STING is the most common variant in the human population, found at a frequency of 57.9% in the 1000 Genome Project. The SNP variant H232 is found at a 13.7% frequency. The G230A, R293Q double mutation occurs in 5.2% of the human population and when expressed in HEK293T cells, this mutation reduces the IFN response to bacterial ligands by 30-40% compared to wild-type STING. Whereas the R293Q substitution alone is severely defective in response to bacterial cyclic dinucleotides, the G230A substitution is thought to help maintain some ability of this variant to respond to bacterial cyclic dinucleotides. Based on crystal structure of STING, the G230A mutation alters the conformation of the lid region that clamps onto the c-di-GMP, however, the R293 residue does not directly bind to c-di-GMP. The R293Q mutation may instead disrupt STING activity indirectly by altering the function of a nearby cysteine residue required for IFN-β expression.",,STING AQ variant (human recombinant),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/23592

The sum of endogenous and food-derived antioxidants represents the total antioxidant activity of the extracellular fluid. Cooperation of all the different antioxidants provides greater protection against attack by reactive oxygen or nitrogen radicals, than any single compound alone. Thus, the overall antioxidant capacity may give more relevant biological information compared to that obtained by the measurement of individual components, as it considers the cumulative effect of all antioxidants present in plasma and body fluids. The Cayman Chemical Antioxidant Assay Kit measures the total antioxidant capacity of plasma, serum, urine, saliva, or cell lysates. The assay relies on the ability of antioxidants in the sample to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS (2,2'-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate]) to ABTS · + by metmyoglobin. The capacity of the antioxidants in the sample to prevent ABTS oxidation is compared with that of Trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol analogue, and is quantified as molar Trolox equivalents.

,,707002,"Catalase (; 2HO oxidoreductase) is an ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme that is present in most aerobic cells. Catalase (CAT) is involved in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide (HO), a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a toxic product of both normal aerobic metabolism and pathogenic ROS production. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of HO to molecular oxygen and two molecules of water (catalytic activity). CAT also demonstrates peroxidatic activity, in which low molecular weight alcohols can serve as electron donors. While the aliphatic alcohols serve as specific substrates for CAT, other enzymes with peroxidatic activity do not utilize these substrates. In humans, the highest levels of catalase are found in liver, kidney, and erythrocytes, where it is believed to account for the majority of hydrogen peroxide decomposition. The Cayman Chemical Catalase Assay Kit utilizes the peroxidatic function of CAT for determination of enzyme activity. The method is based on the reaction of the enzyme with methanol in the presence of an optimal concentration of HO. The formaldehyde produced is measured spectrophotometrically with 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole (Purpald) as the chromogen. Purpald specifically forms a bicyclic heterocycle with aldehydes, which upon oxidation changes from colorless to a purple color.

,,703302,"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous multifunctional enzymes, which play a key role in cellular detoxification. The enzymes protect cells against toxicants by conjugating them to glutathione, thereby neutralizing their electrophilic sites, and rendering the products more water-soluble. The glutathione conjugates are metabolized further to mercapturic acid and then excreted. Based on their sequence homology, substrate specificity, and immunological cross-reactivity, GSTs have been grouped into species-independent classes of isozymes. These classes are comprised of cytosolic enzymes and the fifth form is microsomal. The Cayman Chemical Glutathione S-Transferase Assay Kit measures total GST activity (cytosolic and microsomal) by measuring the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) with reduced glutathione. The conjugation is accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. The rate of increase is directly proportional to the GST activity in the sample.

Methionine oxidation can alter the function(s) of the modified proteins and if not reversed by MetO reductases can be further oxidized to methionine sulfone, an irreversible modification. Methionine oxidation may occur as a by-product of phagocytotic oxidative bursts, normal mitochondrial respiration and may also occur from environmental chemical exposures. The overabundance of methionine sulfoxidation is implicated in age-related diseases. Cellular protein MetO levels may be influenced by the decrease or loss of methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) activity or by an overabundance of ROS leading to increased levels of dysfunctional proteins. The Methionine Sulfoxide Polyclonal Antibody provided in this assay kit detected IgG-containing MetO from sera of Alzheimer’s patients but not from normal control sera. Cayman’s MetO Immunoblotting Kit contains reagents needed for the immunochemical detection of proteins containing MetO residues by western blotting.

,,780051,"Nitric Oxide (NO) is produced in trace quantities by neurons, endothelial cells, platelets, and neutrophils in response to homeostatic stimuli. This NO is scavenged rapidly (t = 4 s) and acts in a paracrine fashion to transduce cellular signals. NO interacts with the HEME prosthetic group of guanylate cyclase, activating the enzyme and leading to increased cGMP levels. Other cells (macrophages, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes) also produce NO in micromolar concentrations in response to inflammatory or mitogenic stimuli. These very high levels of NO lead to the formation of peroxynitrite, destruction of iron-sulphur clusters, thiol nitrosation, and nitration of protein tyrosine residues. Thus, the amount of NO produced in different biological systems can vary over several orders of magnitude and its subsequent chemical reactivity is diverse. The final products of NO  are nitrite (NO) and nitrate (NO). Relative proportions of NO and NO within a sample are variable and cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, the best index of total NO production is the sum of both of these products. Cayman Chemical’s Nitrate/Nitrite Fluorometric Assay Kit provides a convenient method for the quantitation of low levels of NO and NO in biological samples (particularly tissue culture medium). Previously undetectable concentrations of nitrate/nitrite in a variety of samples can be accurately quantitated using this kit as it extends the lower limit of detection by 20-fold over our popular colorimetric version.

,,760871,"NADPH is an essential cofactor for the function of the NOS enzyme. Unfortunately, NADPH interferes with the chemistry of the Griess reagents, which are the most commonly used reagents for nitrite detection. There are two ways to get around this limitation. Vanishingly small amounts of NADPH can be used, in conjunction with a catalytic system for recycling the spent NADP back to NADPH. This is the system used in Cayman’s first Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit (Item No. ). It works well for the analysis of fluids such as plasma and urine, and is also available in a high sensitivity fluorometric version (Item No. ) for the detection of low levels of nitrate and nitrite. However, this method cannot be used to analyze nitrate and nitrite from an  NOS assay in which excess NADPH has been added. The second way to handle the NADPH interference problem is to go ahead and use an excess of NADPH. An additional step is added to the protocol to remove the excess NADPH. This is the avenue we have taken in the development of this nitrate/nitrite assay kit. This kit uses Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) to oxidize the excess NADPH. The kit is particularly well suited to measurements of NOS activity . High throughput screening applications using recombinant nitric oxide synthase (NOS) preparations can be quickly and accurately assayed with the LDH method kit.

During this process, the rate-limiting step of the reaction is catalyzed by the heme oxygenases (HOs), a family of membrane-bound enzymes that initiates the cleavage of heme to give carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous ions (Fe), and biliverdin, with biliverdin being further processed into bilirubin. HO-1, the inducible heme oxygenase of the family encoded by the HMOX1 gene (also known as heat shock protein 32), is found in human spleen, liver, and kidney. Expression of HO-1 is induced by the presence of heme, hormones, metals, oxidative agents, and drugs as defense against oxidative stress and inflammatory response; its substantially up-regulated activities in a variety of cancers are thought to confer cytoprotective properties from host to cancerous tumors, thus making HO-1 a potential target for cancer therapeutics.",,HO-1 (human recombinant),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/22731
,,22738,"Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), also known as heat shock protein family D member 1 (HspD1), is an approximately 60 kDa protein that functions as a molecular chaperone. It belongs to the type I subclass of chaperonins and is found in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts where its expression is induced by stress. Hsp60 primarily exists as a heptameric ring that it is converted to a tetradecameric double-ring structure in the presence of ATP. Within mitochondria, it associates with its co-chaperone, Hsp10, to form a barrel-like structure and refold proteins that have been shuttled to the mitochondria in an  ATP-dependent manner. Hsp60 also has extramitochondrial functions such as the production of proinflammatory cytokines in human leukocytes and activation of innate immune receptors. Hsp60 expression is increased in the serum and saliva of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mutations in  lead to neurodegenerative diseases.

,,22734,"Heat shock protein 90 α (Hsp90α) is the inducible cytosolic isoform of Hsp90 that is encoded by  in humans. Hsp90 is a multidomain protein that functions as a molecular chaperone to assist in folding and activation of nascent peptides, refolding unfolded or misfolded proteins, and preventing protein aggregation. C-terminal dimerization of Hsp90, coupled with ATPase molecular clamp activity induces a conformational change in the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain that facilitates substrate binding and initiates the chaperone cycle. Hsp90 interacts with many co-chaperones during its chaperone cycle including p23 and Sba1, which help recruit substrates to the Hsp90 complex, Hsp70 (Item Nos.  | ), which loads nascent polypeptides onto the Hsp90 dimer, and the ATPase activator Aha1 that promotes ATP hydrolysis and substrate release. Hsp90 is overexpressed in cancer cells and stabilizes client proteins that promote oncogenesis, including transcription factors, signaling proteins, and kinases. Hsp90 also decreases α-synuclein fibril formation and toxicity as well as Q35 aggregation in  models of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, respectively, implying a role in neurodegenerative disease.",,Hsp90α (human recombinant),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/22734
,,22739,"Heat shock protein 70s (Hsp70s) are abundant and stress-inducible 70 kDa molecular chaperone proteins encoded by a highly conserved, multigene family. They are monomeric proteins that can be divided into two functional domains: an N-terminal ATPase domain and a substrate binding domain that contains a highly conserved EEVD motif at its C-terminus. Hsp70s are found in the cytosol, nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and chloroplasts of eukaryotes, as well as in bacteria. They function as molecular chaperones that assist in a wide range of cellular processes, including refolding of aggregated or misfolded proteins, co- and post-translational folding and assembly of nascent peptides, membrane translocation of secretory and organellar proteins, controlling activity of regulatory nuclear receptors, kinases and transcription factors, as well as acting cooperatively with the Hsp90 chaperone system in eukaryotes. The Hsp70 chaperone cycle is ATP-dependent and initiated by transient interaction of the Hsp70 substrate binding domain with hydrophobic regions within a peptide or protein. It consists of an alteration between the low-affinity ATP-bound state with fast rates of substrate exchange and the high-affinity ADP bound state with slow rates of substrate exchange. Hsp70s are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications and their expression is upregulated under conditions of cellular stress and in a variety of disease states.",,Hsp70 (human recombinant),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/22739

,,10011433,"Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) belongs to a family of heat shock transcription factors that activate the transcription of genes encoding products required for protein folding, processing, targeting, degradation, and function. The up-regulation of Hsp expression by stressors is achieved at the level of transcription through a heat shock element (HSE) and a transcription factor. Most Hsfs have highly conserved amino acid sequences. On all Hsfs there is a DNA binding domain at the N-terminus. Hydrophobic repeats located adjacent to this binding domain are essential for the formation of active trimers. Towards the C-terminal region another short hydrophobic repeat exists and is thought to be necessary for suppression of trimerization. There are two main Hsfs, 1 and 2. Murine Hsf1 exists as two isoforms, however in higher eukaryotes Hsf1 is found in a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in unstressed cells. Once exposed to a multitude of stressors, it localizes to discrete nuclear granules within seconds. As it recovers from stress, Hsf1 dissipates from these granules to a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution. Hsf2 on the other hand is similar to murine Hsf1, as it exists as two isoforms, the α form being more transcriptionally active than the smaller β form. Various experiments have suggested that Hsf2 may have roles in differentiation and development.",,Hsf1 Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 10H8),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/10011433

While the LCM assay may be performed as a stand-alone assay, it is has been specifically optimized to be run in multiplex with any of INDIGO’s 96-well, 2 x 48-well, or 3 x 32-well nuclear receptor reporter assay system products. The LCM assay allows users to validate their primary nuclear receptor assay data by determining if their test compound treatments exert mitogenic, cytostatic or cytotoxic activities on the reporter cells. The occurrence of such adverse non-specific effects will always undermine the accurate assessment of a test compound’s potency and/or efficacy as a modulator of nuclear receptor function. When screening test compounds for antagonist activities it is particularly important to quantify changes in the relative number of live reporter cells at the assay endpoint. Test compounds that exert cytostatic, cytotoxic, or cytolytic activities invariably generate “false-positive” results in an antagonist screen. In such cases, the observed drop in luciferase activity will be incorrectly attributed to inhibition of the nuclear receptor by the test compound. In reality, however, the treatment compound has pushed the reporter cells into division arrest, apoptosis, necrosis, or lysis.

,,17585,"This assay system utilizes proprietary human cells engineered to provide constitutive, highlevel expression of the Rat Pregnane X Receptor (nr1i2), a ligand-dependent transcription factor commonly referred to as PXR. PXR is also known as the Steroid and Xenobiotic sensing nuclear Receptor (SXR). INDIGO's Reporter Cells express a hybrid form of the rat PXR. The N-terminal sequence encoding the PXR DNA binding domain (DBD) has been substituted with that of the yeast GAL4-DBD. The native PXR ligand binding domain (LBD) and other C-terminal domains remain intact and functional. Ligand interaction activates the receptor, causing it to binds to the GAL4 DNA binding sequence, which is functionally linked to a resident luciferase reporter gene. Thus, quantifying changes in luciferase activity in the treated reporter cells provides a sensitive surrogate measure of the changes in PXR activity. The principle application of this reporter assay system is in the screening of test samples to quantify any functional activity, either agonist or antagonist, that they may exert against rat PXR.

It regulates the expression of a variety of genesencoding proteins that play critical roles in cyto-protection, as well as the detoxification and clearance of harmful endogenous and xenobiotic substances. In particular, Nrf2 regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that confer cyto-protection against oxidative damage. Under normal conditions Nrf2 resides in the cytoplasm in association with Keap1 and Cullin 3. Within the confines of this protein cluster Nrf2 is the target of ubiquitination and rapid turn-over via proteasomal degradation. However, under conditions of cellular oxidative stress the tight association of Nrf2 with Keap1 and Cullin 3 is broken, effectively disrupting the otherwise efficient process of Nrf2 degradation. Once non-ubiquitinated Nrf2 accumulates in the cytoplasm it translocates into the nucleus, whereupon it forms hetero-dimers with Maf.

The primary effect of leptin appears to be mediated by leptin receptors expressed mainly in the hypothalamus. In humans, leptin levels correlate with body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat, and are elevated even in obese individuals. Leptin has a dual action; it decreases the appetite and increases energy consumption. Leptin is secreted in circadian fashion with nocturnal rise in both lean and obese patients. Mutations of the ob gene resulting in leptin deficiency are the cause of obesity in the  mice suggesting that endogeneous leptin can normalize their body weight. In contrast, human obese subjects may have high level of leptin, indicating a mechanism of leptin resistance. This Enzyme Immunometric Assay (EIA) is based on a double-antibody sandwich technique.

,,25659,"Present in nature in the form of iodide and iodate, iodine is a solid halogen at normal temperature. It is used in medicine, in the pharmaceutical and food industry. Food is the principal daily supply of iodide in human body. Iodide is important in basal metabolism and permits temperature regulation, intellectual development for children, muscular development, normal heart function and growth of skeleton. Iodide transport is the basis for an emerging approach of selective cancer cell destruction. Iodide uptake from blood into thyroid follicular cells is the first step in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones T4 and T3, known to regulate many essential biological processes.Thyroid hormones are indispensable for body development. This transport is mediated by NIS (sodium iodide symporter), an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein located in the basolateral membrane of thyrocytes. Since the discovery of NIS, thorough biochemical analysis has elucidated the mechanism of basolateral iodide transport and revealed the key role of NIS in thyroid diseases such as thyroid cancer, autoimmune disease, and congenital hypothyroidism. If rate is not in the normal proportion, some diseases can be developed as underactive thyroid if the rate is too down or overactive thyroid if the rate is too up. Other diseases exist as chronic thyroiditis of Hashimoto or cancer of the thyroid gland. Iodide deficiency is at origins of many thyroid metabolism disorders, this is why it is important to control rate of iodide to prevent all of these diseases. This Iodide Assay is based on the oxido-reduction reaction: cerium(IV) is reduced by arsenic(III). The reduction of yellow (420 nm) cerium(IV) to colorless cerium(III) by arsenic(III) proceeds very slowly but traces of iodide strongly accelerate this reaction with the rate being directly proportional to iodide concentration. For a given time, decay is inversely proportional to iodide concentration in well.

Specific impurities coming from the cells mediating the protein expression, known as ‘Host Cell Proteins (HCP)', are generated and need to be removed. This kit is intended for use in assessing relative quantities of  HCP in manufactured or research bioproducts. Polyclonal antibodies used in this kit have been generated against several strains of  and specifically selected for their recognition of a large spectrum of  proteins. Thus, this kit can be considered as generic and allows a relative-quantitative determination of  HCP in many types of samples, such as samples issued from the purification process (HCP clearance), process control, quality control, or product release. Using this kit, HCP concentration is measured in ng/ml (HCP equivalent is extrapolated from a standard curve). Conventionally, the HCP content in a product will finally be expressed in ng/mg, where ng represents HCP mass and mg represents the product mass. Note that contrary to the concentration measurement of the product, the HCP signal is only reflective of antibody binding and does not strictly reflect the mass of HCP. This kit has been successfully validated for recovery and precision using reconstituted HCP samples and tested against different final products. Given the diversity of final products, all potential matrix effects cannot be known and it is recommended that you test the suitability of the kit for use with your own HCP samples in your laboratory.

Ingestion of DA-contaminated shellfish causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and has been linked to the death of animal and human consumers in severe cases. The European Commission Directive 2002/226/EC has implemented a maximum permitted level (MPL) of 20 mg DA/kg shellfish flesh intended for human consumption, and this level has been adopted by regulatory authorities in most other countries. The ASP ELISA is specific for DA with no cross-reactivity to non-toxic, structural analogues like kainic acid, L-glutamic acid, L-glutamine, formimino-L-glutamic acid, proline or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

SET7/9 (KMT7) is a SET domain-containing mono-methyltransferase that acts on a large number of histone and non-histone targets including histone H3, TAF10, p53, viral Tat, and estrogen receptor α. Given this broad substrate specificity, SET7/9 has important implications for a variety of human diseases, and SET7/9 has emerged as a model for studying the catalytic mechanism SET domain histone methyltransferases. This fluorescence polarization assay is based upon a proprietary small molecule fluorescent probe* that binds to the SAM binding pocket in SET7/9. Binding of the small molecule probe to SET7/9 induces an increase in fluorescence polarization. Binding of the probe can be competed with the endogenous cofactor SAM or by the inhibitor sinefungin, but is unaffected by the histone H3 peptide substrate. The SET7/9 SAM-Screener™ Assay is robust (Z’ >0.6) and exhibits a greater than 100 mP shift over a range of 0-250 nM SET7/9.

,,600007,"Prostaglandin D (PGD) is synthesized by hematopoietic-type PGD-synthase (H-PGDS) in mast cells and is released in large quantities during allergic and asthmatic anaphylaxis. H-PGDS is therefore a key target  for development of selective, potent inhibitors for therapeutic use against these diseases. Cayman’s H-PGDS FP-Based Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit - Green provides a rapid, accurate assay for screening H-PGDS inhibitors. In this assay, a H-PGDS inhibitor-fluorescein conjugate serves as a specific fluorescent probe for the enzyme. Displacement of the probe by any unlabeled H-PGDS inhibitor leads to a decrease in the fluorescence polarization (FP) state of the probe, providing a direct signal for binding of the inhibitor to the active site of the enzyme. This assay is robust (Z’ of 0.75) and eliminates the need for the traditional multistep assay that requires the use of highly unstable PGH. The assay has been validated using several known inhibitors of H-PGDS with IC values ranging from nanomolar to millimolar concentrations.",,"Prostaglandin D Synthase (hema,topoietic-,type) FP-,Based Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit - Green",https://www.caymanchem.com/product/600007

This PGD accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it induces physiologic sleep in rats and humans. PGD is also synthesized in mast cells and leukocytes by a cellular, myeloid-type, glutathione-dependent PGD synthase. This PGD which is formed in the intracellular and vascular compartments is rapidly metabolized to 11β-PGF and other metabolites. Measurement of the parent eicosanoid PGD is appropriate in cell culture lysates and in CSF, where concentrations of several hundred pg/ml have been measured.

,,700520,"D(−)-Lactate is a stereoisomer of lactate and is present in blood at only 1-5% the concentration of L(+)-lactate. Exogenous sources of D-lactate include fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut, and pickles. D-lactate is normally produced in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria or is produced in the cytosol of cells by the glyoxylase pathway. Cayman’s D-Lactate Assay provides a fluorescence-based method for detecting D-lactate in biological samples such as serum, plasma, blood, urine, and saliva. It can also be utilized to determine intracellular and extracellular lactate concentrations in cell culture samples. In the assay, D-lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of D-lactate to pyruvate, along with the concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH. NADH reacts with the fluorescent substrate to yield a highly fluorescent product. The fluorescent product is analyzed with an excitation wavelength of 530-540 nm and an emission wavelength of 585-595 nm.",,"D-,Lactate Assay Kit",https://www.caymanchem.com/product/700520
,,600480,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) exists in an oxidized form, NAD, as well as a reduced form, NADH. NAD, the main free form in cells, functions in modulating cellular redox status and by controlling signaling and transcriptional events, making it an important cofactor when investigating normal cellular function. Cayman’s NAD/NADH Cell-Based Assay Kit provides a colorimetric method for measuring intracellular NAD and NADH in cultured cells. In this assay, NAD found in cell samples is reduced to NADH by alcohol dehydrogenase during the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. The newly formed and the existing NADH found in the samples is then oxidized resulting in the reduction of a tetrazolium salt substrate (WST-1) to a highly-colored formazan which absorbs at 450 nm. The amount of formazan produced is proportional to the amount of total NAD in the cell lysate and can be used as an indicator of the total cellular NAD concentration.",,NAD/NADH Cell-Based Assay Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/600480
,,703102,"Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides, including hydrogen peroxides, by reduced glutathione and functions to protect the cell from oxidative damage. With the exception of phospholipid-hydroperoxide GPX, a monomer, all of the GPX enzymes are tetramers of four identical subunits. Each subunit contains a selenocysteine in the active site which participates directly in the two-electron reduction of the peroxide substrate. The enzyme uses glutathione as the ultimate electron donor to regenerate the reduced form of the selenocysteine. The Cayman Chemical Glutathione Peroxidase Assay Kit measures GPX activity indirectly by a coupled reaction with glutathione reductase (GR). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG), produced upon reduction of an organic hydroperoxide by GPX, is recycled to its reduced state by GR and NADPH. The oxidation of NADPH to NADP is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The rate of decrease in the A is directly proportional to the GPX activity in the sample. The Cayman GPX Assay Kit can be used to measure all of the glutathione-dependent peroxidases in plasma, erythrocyte lysates, tissue homogenates, and cell lysates.",,Glutathione Peroxidase Assay Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/703102

,,515211,"Prostacyclin (Prostaglandin I; PGI) is formed from arachidonic acid primarily by the vascular endothelium and renal cortex. It is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. PGI is non-enzymatically hydrated to 6-keto PGF (t = 2-3 minutes), and then quickly converted to the major metabolite, 2,3-dinor-6-keto PGF (t = 30 minutes). Prostacyclin was once thought to be a circulating hormone that regulated platelet-vasculature interactions, but the rate of secretion into circulation coupled with the short half-life indicate that prostacyclin functions locally. Although 6-keto PGF is commonly measured in plasma and urine as an estimate of prostacyclin synthesis, it should be noted that there may be more than one source of PGI in these samples. For instance, venipuncture may cause the release of prostacyclin which will artifactually increase the 6-keto PGF concentration in plasma. Urinary concentrations of 6-keto PGF are confounded by the fact that some plasma prostacyclin (~14%) is excreted into urine as 6-keto PGF and the remainder is of renal origin. Therefore, it is important to take these factors into account when analyzing data.",,"6-,keto Prostaglandin F, ELISA Kit",https://www.caymanchem.com/product/515211
,,516011,"Prostaglandin F (PGF) is one of the five primary PGs derived enzymatically directly from the endoperoxide PGH. It was initially discovered in seminal fluid, and to date the majority of the functional roles ascribed to it relate to fertility, pregnancy, and parturition. PGF is a potent luteolytic agent and is used to induce ovulation in domestic livestock. It is also a potent uterine stimulant, and is part of the cascade of myometrial stimulants which induce and sustain labor. PGF is rapidly metabolized to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF , and the levels of this metabolite in both plasma and amniotic fluid are elevated during active labor in several different mammalian species. Like all of the primary PGs, PGF. has a very short half-life in the general circulation. The plasma concentration of PGF in humans is <10 pg/ml, and probably no more than 1-2 pg/ml. PGF is rapidly metabolized by 15-hydroxy PG dehydrogenase and both β- and ω-oxidation systems to a variety of polar metabolites. In primary cultures, the metabolism of PGF is much more limited, and it may collect in the supernatant medium to easily measured concentrations. Amnionic and placental tissue PGF content in the range from 100-250 ng/g of tissue has been reported. However, this study did not address the presence of isoprostanes and reported measurements using an unvalidated RIA method. A controlled GC- or LC-MS study of tissue PG content has not been reported.

,,501100,"Prostaglandin I (Prostaglandin I; PGI) is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation that is formed from arachidonic acid primarily in the vascular endothelium and renal cortex by sequential activities of cyclooxygenase (COX) and PGI synthase. It is non-enzymatically hydrated to 6-keto PGF (t = 2-3 minutes), and then quickly converted to numerous downstream metabolites, collectively known as prostaglandin I metabolites or PGIM, (t = 30 minutes). Although 6-keto PGF is commonly measured in plasma and urine as an estimate of PGI synthesis, it should be noted that there may be more than one source of PGI in these samples. For instance, urinary concentrations of 6-keto PGF are confounded by the fact that only a portion originates from plasma and the remainder is produced by the kidney. These problems are circumvented by measuring downstream PGIM rather than 6-keto PGF as an indicator of systemic PGI production. Cayman's PGIM ELISA Kit is a competitive assay that can be used for quantification of PGIM in urine and other sample matrices.

The assay has a range from 0.23-30 pmol/ml and a sensitivity (80% B/B) of approximately 1 pmol/ml. Since the antibody used in this assay was prepared against a cGMP-carrier protein conjugate, antibody binding is increased if an acetyl group is present on the 2' hydroxyl group of the cGMP. The optional acetylation procedure for both samples and standards increases the sensitivity of the assay approximately 10 fold. A protocol for acetylating both the standards and samples prior to performing the assay is provided. Basal levels of cGMP in cell lysates can often be measured without acetylation, but results will depend on the type and number of cells being utilized. Platelets produce approximately 1.5-2.5 pmol cGMP/10 platelets under basal conditions.

,,700190,"β-Hydroxybutyrate (β-HB; 3-hydroxybutyric acid) is a “ketone body” which is produced in the liver, mainly from the oxidation of fatty acids, and is exported to peripheral tissues for use as an energy source. The term ‘ketone body’ refers to three molecules, acetoacetate, β-HB, and acetone. β-HB and acetoacetate transport energy from the liver to the other tissues and acetone is generated by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. The presence of ketosis may be normal or pathologic. Normally ketosis can indicate that lipid metabolism has been activated and the pathway of lipid degradation is intact. Normal ketosis is prevalent in many circumstances such as during fasting, after prolonged exercise or after a high fat diet. Pathological causes of ketosis include multiple organ failure, diabetes, childhood hypoglycemia, corticosteroid or growth hormone deficiency, intoxication with alcohol or salicylates and several inborn errors of metabolism. In acutely ill patients, these ketone bodies can accumulate in the body to cause ketoacidosis, which leads to the potentially life threatening condition known as metabolic acidosis. The presence and degree of ketosis can be determined by measuring blood levels of β-HB. Ordinarily, β-HB accounts for approximately 75% of the ketone bodies in serum. Measurement of β-HB provides a reliable index of the level of ketoacidosis, including the detection of subclinical ketosis. In diabetics, β-HB measurements (and blood glucose) can be used for the assessment of the severity of diabetic coma and is essential for the exclusion of hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma. The measurement of β-HB is also used to monitor insulin requirements, based on existing hyperketonemia. β-HB has more recently been evaluated for use in neurodegenerative diseases and inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis. Cayman’s β-HB (Ketone Body) Assay Kit provides a simple, reproducible, and sensitive tool for measuring β-HB levels in plasma, serum, urine, cell lysates, or tissue homogenates. The method for β-HB determination is based upon the oxidation of D-3-Hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate by the enzyme 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Concomitant with this oxidation, the cofactor NAD is reduced to NADH.

,,582281,"Estriol, a metabolite of 17β-estradiol and a major estrogen produced during pregnancy, has historically been used as an indicator of fetal well-being. In the final weeks before parturition, estriol levels increase significantly. In a longitudinal study in healthy pregnant women, total plasma estriol levels increased from <10 ng/ml at 8-10 weeks gestation to approximately 150 ng/ml at week 38. The majority of the estriol synthesized in the later stages of pregnancy originates from fetal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and serves as a direct marker of fetal adrenal gland activity. In the 1960s and 1970s plasma and urine were used to measure estriol. However, saliva contains primarily unbound and unconjugated estriol, the biologically active form of the hormone, and therefore is currently a commonly used biological fluid for monitoring estriol levels. Plasma levels of estriol in males and non-pregnant females is less than 2 ng/ml.",,Estriol ELISA Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/582281
,,700740,"β-Hydroxybutyrate (β-HB; 3-hydroxybutyric acid) is produced in the liver, mainly from the oxidation of fatty acids, and exported to peripheral tissues for use as an energy source. Measurement of β-HB can provide a reliable index of the level of normal ketosis as well as detect pathological ketoacidosis, including the assessment of the severity of diabetic coma and  monitor insulin requirements in diabetic patients. Cayman’s β-HB (Ketone Body) Fluorometric Assay Kit provides a simple, reproducible, and sensitive tool for assaying β-HB from plasma, serum, urine, tissue homogenates, and cell culture samples. The method for β-HB determination is based upon the oxidation of D-3-Hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate by the enzyme 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Concomitant with this oxidation, the cofactor NAD is reduced to NADH.

,,601070,"Neutrophils are short-lived inflammatory cells that are highly adept at ingesting and destroying bacteria as part of the first line of defense in the innate immune response to many pathogenic organisms. They produce an extensive arsenal of defensive antimicrobial proteins and peptides including lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, cathepsins, and the alpha- and beta-defensins. Neutrophils also form extracellular traps, web-like structures composed of DNA, histones, and various antimicrobial proteins that are extruded from the neutrophil in order to ensnare and kill extracellular pathogens. In mice, neutrophils comprise ~10% of circulating white blood cells, so unlike humans, it is usually not possible to isolate even one million neutrophils from a single mouse from peripheral blood. Cayman’s Neutrophil (mouse) Isolation Kit provides a streamlined method for isolating mouse neutrophils by peritoneal lavage.

,,501050,"The primary synthesis of functional vitamin D begins in the skin, where a cholesterol by-product acted upon by UV light forms vitamin D. Vitamin D is carried through the bloodstream, attached to the vitamin D binding protein, to the liver where it is converted to 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D). This product is then transported to the kidney where it is further converted to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)D), the biologically active form. Active 1,25(OH)D is very short-lived and is rapidly metabolized to its deactivated forms.  Cayman’s Vitamin D EIA Kit is a competitive assay that can be used for Vitamin D quantification in plasma or serum. Because of the short half-life of the biologically active 1,25(OH)D form, this Vitamin D assay primarily detects the more metabolically stable forms, 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D. Accurate detection of these forms requires that they be displaced from the vitamin D binding protein prior to measurement.

,,703002,"Cayman’s GSH assay kit utilizes a carefully optimized enzymatic recycling method, using glutathione reductase for the quantification of GSH. The sulfhydryl group of GSH reacts with DTNB (5,5'-dithio--2-nitrobenzoic acid, Ellman’s reagent) and produces a yellow colored 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB). The mixed disulfide, GSTNB (between GSH and TNB) that is concomitantly produced, is reduced by glutathione reductase to recycle the GSH and produce more TNB. The rate of TNB production is directly proportional to this recycling reaction which in turn is directly proportional to the concentration of GSH in the sample. Measurement of the absorbance of TNB at 405 or 412 nm provides an accurate estimation of GSH in the sample. GSH is easily oxidized to the disulfide dimer GSSG. Because of the use of glutathione reductase in the Cayman GSH assay kit, both GSH and GSSG are measured and the assay reflects total glutathione.

PGF was initially discovered in seminal fluid, and to date the majority of the functional roles ascribed to it relate to fertility, pregnancy, and parturition. PGF is a potent luteolytic agent and is used to induce ovulation in domestic livestock. It is also a potent uterine stimulant, and is part of the cascade of myometrial stimulants which induce and sustain labor. PGF is rapidly metabolized to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF , by the enzymes 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase and Δ-reductucase. Measurement of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF in plasma can be used as a marker of the  production of PGF. The Cayman Chemical 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF Enzyme Immunoassay is a competitive assay that provides measurements of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF within the range of 2.3-5,000 pg/ml, typically with a detection limit (80% B/B) of approximately 15 pg/ml.

,,700930,"Complex I (NADH oxidase/Co-enzyme Q reductase) is one of the major sites of electron entry into the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Complex I catalyzes the 2 electron oxidation of NADH followed by the reduction of ubiquinone (Q) to form ubiquinol (QH), and ultimately the reduction of the terminal electron acceptor, O. During the passage of electrons from NADH to Q, the translocation of four protons (H) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space occurs, contributing to the chemiosmotic proton gradient, which is required for oxidative phosphorylation. Cayman's MitoCheck Complex I Activity Assay allows for the activity of complex I to be determined without the need to isolate mitochondria or pre-incubate with antibodies. The rate of NADH oxidation is measured by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm and is proportional to the activity of complex I.

,,514531,"Prostaglandin E (PGE) is produced by a variety of cell types which, in general, do not contain the enzymes required for metabolism of PGE. Thus, cultured endothelial cells or osteoblasts will release PGE into the culture medium, where it will accumulate without appreciable metabolism. The direct assay of PGE from the medium is a good way to measure PGE production from these cells. PGE is rapidly converted  to its 13,14-dihydro-15-keto metabolite, with more than 90% of circulating PGE cleared by a single passage through the lungs. Unfortunately, this metabolite is not chemically stable and undergoes a variable amount of degradation to PGA products. For this reason, blood, urine, or other samples from whole animals or humans often contain very little intact PGE, and measurement of the metabolites is necessary to provide a reliable estimate of actual PGE production. Cayman’s PGE Metabolite assay was developed as a method of converting 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGA and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE to a single, stable derivative that could be easily quantified by ELISA. This assay is therefore the method of choice if the samples in question have undergone extensive metabolism prior to collection.",,Prostaglandin E Metabolite ELISA Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/514531
,,700950,"Complex III (CoQ cytochrome  oxidoreductase) is an essential protein for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Complex III functions as both a gatekeeper for mitochondrial respiration and as a major source of reactive oxygen species III.

Once bound to complex III, QH undergoes a series of redox reactions, known as the Q-cycle. During the Q-cycle, electrons are passed from QH onto cytochrome   the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome  resulting in the translocation of 4H and the generation of 0. Cayman's MitoCheck Complex II/III Activity Assay measures the reduction of excess cytochrome  (550 nm absorbance) as catalyzed by complex III. This assay is coupled to succinate co-enzyme Q oxidoreductase (complex II) for the generation of QH.

,,512011,"Prostaglandin D (PGD) is biosynthesized in the brain by a soluble, 26 kD glutathione-independent lipocalin-type PGD synthase. PGD accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it induces physiologic sleep in rats and humans. PGD is also synthesized by mast cells and leukocytes by a cellular, myeloid-type, glutathione-dependent PGD synthase. This PGD which is formed in the intracellular and vascular compartments is rapidly metabolized to 11β-PGF. Thus, urinary measurements of PGD synthesis are most appropriately focused on the measurement of 11β-PGF. Measurement of the parent eicosanoid PGD is appropriate in the supernatants of cell cultures, where PGD levels may reach several ng/ml, and in CSF, where concentrations of several hundred pg/ml have been measured. All studies of PGD biosynthesis should take into consideration the chemical instability of PGD and its rapid degradation in the presence of serum proteins such as albumin. PGD also readily degrades in both acidic and basic media to give a variety of decomposition products. Similarly, antigenic protein conjugates of PGD, synthesized for the production of antisera, show considerable amounts of decomposition. Thus, the resulting antibody response is heterogeneous with poor specificity. This makes PGD assay systems based on the parent compound unreliable and difficult to interpret. This PGD-MOX ELISA is based on the conversion of PGD to a stable MOX derivative. Treatment of the sample with methoxylamine hydrochloride (MOX HCl) converts PGD into PGD-MOX, preventing its further chemical degradation. The antiserum used in the assay was developed using conjugates of this derivative and is very specific for PGD-MOX. The assay has been validated against stable isotope dilution GC/MS.

Cyclic AMP is a ubiquitous cellular second messenger that is a critical component of a signal transduction pathway linking membrane receptors and their ligands to the activation of internal cellular enzymatic activity and gene expression. cAMP is synthesized from ATP by membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Binding of certain ligands or hormones to their specific G-protein couple receptors activates GTP binding proteins (G or G) which either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase. cAMP activates or inhibits various enzymes or cascade of enzymes by promoting their phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. The cAMP signal is neutralized by hydrolysis of cAMP to AMP by phosphodiesterases. Therefore, the concentration of cAMP in a cell is a function of the ratio of the rate of synthesis from ATP by adenylate cyclase and its rate of breakdown to AMP by specific phosphodiesterases.",,Cyclic AMP Select ELISA Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/501040
,,516521,"Prostaglandin D (PGD) is the major eicosanoid released from stimulated mast cells. PGD is an unstable compound which is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the circulation. This makes quantitation of PGD an unreliable indicator of its  production. 11β-PGF is the primary plasma metabolite of PGD , the levels of which can increase from 6 pg/ml in a normal healthy volunteer to 490 ng/ml in patients with systemic mastocytosis. The normal human urinary excretion of 11β-PGF is about 11 ng/mmol creatinine (~400 ng/24 hr), which is increased nearly 3-fold upon allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics. Unlike most prostaglandin metabolites, 11β-PGF retains potent biological activity. 11-β-PGF is equipotent to PGF in inducing human bronchial smooth muscle contractions and inhibition of adipose differentiation. 11β-PGF was also shown to inhibit ADP or thrombin-induced human platelet aggregation at concentrations of 0.14 to 2.8 µM.  The Cayman 11β-PGF Assay is a competitive assay that provides accurate measurements of 11β-PGF within the range of 1.6-1,000 pg/ml. Inter and intra-assay CV’s of less than 15% can be achieved at most concentrations. This assay allows sensitive detection of 11β-PGF in the most common sample matrix, which is urine. For plasma and other complex sample matrices, we recommend purification of the sample prior to analysis; a purification protocol is included in the kit booklet. Measurements of 11β-PGF in urine using our ELISA gives values in the same range, but slightly higher than those obtained by GC-MS. This appears to be due to measurement of 11β-PGF plus the 2,3-dinor metabolite of 11β-PGF.",,"11β-,Prostaglandin F, ELISA Kit",https://www.caymanchem.com/product/516521
,,601170,"Necrosis is accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and increased plasma membrane permeability, while apoptosis involves an articulated breakdown of the cell into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a soluble cytosolic enzyme that is released into the culture medium following loss of membrane integrity resulting from cell- or compound-induced cytotoxicity. LDH activity, therefore, can be used as an indicator of cell membrane integrity and serve as a general means to assess cell viability by measuring plasma membrane permeability. Cayman's LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit measures cell death in response to chemical compounds or environmental factors using a coupled two-step reaction. In the first step, LDH catalyzes the reduction of NAD to NADH and H by oxidation of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step of the reaction, diaphorase uses the newly-formed NADH and H to catalyze the reduction of a tetrazolium salt (INT) to highly-colored formazan which absorbs strongly at 490-520 nm.",,LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/601170
,,10009349,"Cayman’s Cell Cycle Phase Determination Kit provides an easy to use tool for studying the induction and inhibition of cell cycle progression in any cell suspension sample. The assay involves the fixation and permeabilization of the cells of interest, making possible the staining of DNA within intact cells by propidium iodide. This kit will allow the investigator to determine the percentage of cells in a given sample that are within G/G, G, or S phase at the time of fixation, as well as to quantify cells in the sub-G phase prior to apoptosis.",,Cell Cycle Phase Determination Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/10009349
,,700480,"Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose in animal and human cells. Glycogen is made primarily by the liver and muscles, but it can also be made by glycogenesis within the brain and stomach. Cayman’s Glycogen Assay provides a simple, reproducible, and sensitive tool for assaying glycogen from tissue. In this assay, glycogen is hydrolyzed by amyloglucosidase to form β-D-glucose, which is then specifically oxidized to D-glucono-δ-lactone by glucose oxidase forming hydrogen peroxide in the process. Hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, reacts with 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP) in a 1:1 stoichiometry to generate the highly fluorescent product resorufin which is measure  at an excitation wavelength of 530-540 nm and an emission wavelength of 585-595 nm.",,Glycogen Assay Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/700480
,,500360,"Cortisol is a glucocorticoid produced by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). It is secreted with a circadian periodicity, and peaks just prior to waking in the morning. Cortisol is often elevated in major depressive disorder, certain forms of hypertension, stress, AIDS, and in the visceral fat of obese individuals. Cortisol can be measured in many matrices including blood, urine, and saliva. In serum, approximately 90-95% of cortisol is bound to proteins. Urinary cortisol is not bound to proteins, but its levels are dependent on glomerular and tubular function. In saliva, approximately 67% of cortisol is unbound. There is generally good correlation between cortisol measurements in saliva and serum. Cayman’s Cortisol ELISA Kit is a competitive assay that can be used for quantification of cortisol in urine, plasma, and other sample matrices.  The assay has a range from 6.6-4,000 pg/ml and a sensitivity (80% B/B) of approximately 35 pg/ml.",,Cortisol ELISA Kit,https://www.caymanchem.com/product/500360
,,581001,"Cayman’s cAMP assay is a very sensitive competitive ELISA that permits cAMP measurements within the standard curve range of 0.078-10 pmol/ml, typically with a sensitivity (80% B/B) of 0.1 pmol/ml once samples and standards have been acetylated prior to analysis. This assay has been validated with culture media, urine, tissue, and plasma samples. If you prefer to assay your samples and still achieve excellent sensitivity without the need to perform a pre-assay acetylation step we recommend using Cayman’s cAMP Select ELISA Kit.

,,15435,"The prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP) is one of four G protein-coupled receptors that mediate the actions of prostaglandin E (PGE; Item No. ). Binding of PGE to the EP receptor causes an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP, which plays important roles in bone formation and resorption, cancer, and atherosclerosis. KMN-80 is a substituted γ-lactam (pyrrolidinone) derivative of PGE (Item No. ) that acts as a selective and potent agonist of EP with an IC value of 3 nM (IC = 1.4 μM for EP and > 10 μM for all other prostanoid receptors). In functional assays it has been shown to stimulate secreted alkaline phosphatase gene reporter activity in EP-transfected HEK293 cells with an EC value of 0.19 nM, demonstrating >5,000 and 50,000-fold selectivity against EP and TP, respectively. KMN-80 can induce the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells from both young and aged rats into osteoblasts  (ECs = 20 and 153 nM, respectively) and exhibits favorable tolerability up to at least 10 μM, whereas the EP agonist L-902,688 (Item No. ) is highly cytotoxic at similar concentrations in these cells. KMN-80 has been used to repair calvarial defects in an  rat craniomaxillofacial reconstruction model (rate of reduction in defect size equivalent to BMP-2 treated rats) and to promote bone formation in a rat incisor tooth socket model.",,"KMN-,80",https://www.caymanchem.com/product/15435
,,501270,"Immunization of mice with citrullinated human fibrinogen, especially mice expressing the human HLA-DR4 transgene, induces an arthritic response driven by the production of antibodies that recognize citrullinated epitopes. The polyclonal antibody response produces antibodies reactive with both citrullinated human fibrinogen and unmodified, noncitrullinated human fibrinogen. Cayman’s Anti-Citrullinated Human Fibrinogen Assay (mouse) is an immunometric (sandwich) assay that can be used to distinguish the antibody response to citrullinated human fibrinogen from the antibody response to unmodified human fibrinogen in mouse serum or plasma. A human fibrinogen affinity sorbent is provided with the kit so that any antibodies capable of reacting with non-citrullinated (unmodified) fibrinogen can be removed prior to analysis of the remaining anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies for an accurate analysis of the anti-citrulline response. This kit uses a citrullinated human fibrinogen-coated plate and a detection antibody recognizing mouse IgG. An anti-citrullinated human fibrinogen monoclonal antibody is included as a standard. The standard curve spans the range of 0.15 to 10 µg/ml, with an an LLOQ of 0.15 µg/ml.",,Anti-Citrullinated Human Fibrinogen Assay Kit (mouse),https://www.caymanchem.com/product/501270
